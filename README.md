#### This repo contains
* __tactile tracing.__
    * Tactile garment edge tracing for unfolding.
* __ridgeback.__
    * Combine baxter and ridgeback urdf.
* __active pre-grasp manipulation training.__
    * It relies on pytorch-blender.
* __contrastive learning garment physics.__
* __simulation environment for robot-assisted dressing.__
    * It is bult in Blender simulation.
* __robot-assisted dressing pipeline.__
    * It has been tested with Baxter robot, Clearpath Ridgeback and Robotic grippers.
    
#### Dependencies
